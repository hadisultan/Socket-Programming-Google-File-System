# Socket-Programming-Google-File-System
An implementation of the Google File System (GFS) using basic chunk servers and low level socket programming in Python 2.7.
Concurrent writes and random writes are supported.

How to run:
1) Run controller.py on a terminal.
2) Store server.py in multiple directories and run on a terminal in each directory (tested to run on at least 7 different directories).
3) Run client.py on a terminal. (The file system supports multiple clients so this step can be done multiple time for multiple clients).
